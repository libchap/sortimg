This is

*** SORTIMG ***

program. This tool is intended for rapid image resizing and slight editation.



How to build under GNU/Linux:

 - install QT4 development package (qt4-dev or qt4-devel package on most systems)
 - run 'qmake' ('/usr/lib64/qt4/bin/qmake' on some systems) in the sources directory
 - run 'make'
 - run 'make install' as root (e.g. 'sudo make install')
 - run 'sortimg' from any directory to run the program
 
 
How to build under Windows:

 - install latest QT4/MinGW from http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/
   (e.g. http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.6/qt-opensource-windows-x86-mingw482-4.8.6-1.exe )
 - during the installation, choose to download MinGW and unpack it
 - modify environment variables (My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment variables):
   QTDIR=C:\Qt\4.?.?; QMAKESPEC=win32-g++; PATH+=C:\Qt\4.?.?\bin;C:\mingw32\bin (please check the paths)
 - run 'qmake' and 'make' in the sortimg directory - this will produce debug\sortimg.exe (not portable)
